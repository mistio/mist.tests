  Scenario Outline: Add cloud for multiple providers
    When I click the "new cloud" button with id "addBtn"
    Then I expect the "Cloud" add form to be visible within max 5 seconds
    When I select the "<provider>" provider
    And I wait for 3 seconds
    Then I expect the field "Title" in the cloud add form to be visible within max 4 seconds
    When I use my "<provider>" credentials
    And I focus on the button "Add Cloud" in "cloud" add form
    And I click the button "Add Cloud" in "cloud" add form
    And I wait for the links in homepage to appear
    And I scroll the clouds list into view
    Then the "<provider>" provider should be added within 120 seconds
